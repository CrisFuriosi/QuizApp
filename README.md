Udacity Android Basic Nanodegree - 3rd project: Quiz App
---------
It is a little quiz game about Milan city in Italy.
There are 5 questions, but user can score up to 9 points, as CheckBox questions give 3 points (one for every single CheckBox).

All images come from https://pxhere.com/ site.

I tested the app using HUAWEI VNS-L31 (Android 7.0, API 24).
